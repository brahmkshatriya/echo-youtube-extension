## Youtube Extension for Echo

This extension allows you to play youtube music on [Echo](https://github.com/brahmkshatriya/echo).
It uses the [YTM-kt](https://github.com/toasterofbread/ytm-kt/) library to load everything.

### Big thanks to [Talo](https://github.com/toasterofbread) for making the library.
